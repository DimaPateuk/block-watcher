## Emergency Contacts

```yaml
# Update with your team's contacts
oncall:
  primary: "+1-555-1234"
  secondary: "+1-555-5678"
  
slack:
  channel: "#prod-alerts"
  
escalation:
  level1: "Platform Team"
  level2: "Engineering Manager"
  level3: "CTO"
```

## Rollback Procedure

If deployment fails:

```bash
# 1. Rollback deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/block-watcher -n block-watcher

# 2. Check status
kubectl rollout status deployment/block-watcher -n block-watcher

# 3. Restore database (if needed)
kubectl exec -i -n block-watcher deployment/postgres -- \
  psql -U postgres blockwatcher < backup.sql

# 4. Verify application
curl https://api.yourdomain.com/api/health/liveness

# 5. Notify team
# Post in #prod-alerts Slack channel
```

## Next Steps After Production

1. **Week 1:** Monitor closely, fix any issues
2. **Week 2:** Optimize based on real usage
3. **Month 1:** Review metrics, adjust alerts
4. **Month 3:** Plan next features
5. **Ongoing:** Regular security updates
